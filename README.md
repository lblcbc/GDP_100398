#### An exploration into the development of countries globally; evaluating the World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators as predictors of GDP per Capita. 

The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the major predictors of GDP per capita. Such an analysis establishes a basis from which causality can be discussed, though it's clear that, given the scope of this analysis, the findings exclusively emphasise correlation rather than cause-and-effect relationships. That said, the relevance remains that cuastation often requires correlation, and therefore this analysis hopes to shed light on the issues involved in outlining indicators by which countries and their development are, and should be, measured.
